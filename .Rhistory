# Questions
# ******************************************
# 1.Provide an interpretation for the intercept coefficient.
#   What does it mean if both predictors are equal to 0?
# ------------------------------------------
#Note:The dependent variable (admit) of the original data set is a probability
#     bound by 0 and 1.  The logistic regression model transforms admit to a
#     continuous variable to match both GPA and GRE via the log of the odds
#     -- or, log of p(admit)/(1-p(admit)) then computes by minimizing the sum of
#     the logistic loss.
# - The intercept coefficient, B0=-0.8098.
# - This is the log odds of acceptance to the university when both predictors = 0.
# - A negative log odds means that the odds of acceptance is less than 0.50
# - Taking e to the log odds presents an easier view of the number and converts to odds
Odds <- exp(logistic.regression$coefficients[1])  # 0.4449691

# (Intercept)       GRE         GPA

# 2a. Assuming an average value for GRE, calculate the effect of a one unit

# - Execute the provided R script to answer the questions related to ANOVA models.
#   This assignment uses a data set on crabs and require us to use gender and species
#   of crab to predict the body depth of the animal.
# - Answer the provided questions:
# 1.  In one-way ANOVA, what is the sum of squares between for gender?
#     Answer to 2 decimal places:
#     ANSWER: 18.79     See model results below for detail
# 2.  In one-way ANOVA, what is the sum of squares within for gender?
#     Answer to 2 decimal places:
#     ANSWER: 2315.30   See model results below for detail
# 3.  Does Gender have a significant effect on body depth for crabs? Yes/No?
#     Answer - NO
#     - Small F value (1.61) means this predictor is not effective in accounting for variation
#       in body depth of crabs.
#     - P-value >> 0.05.  Therefore, this is in agreement that gender does not
#       have a significant effect on body depth for crabs
# 4.  When performing two-way ANOVA, which of the main effects are significant?
#       a. None
#       b. Gender
#       c. Species
#       d. Both
#     Answer - Species is significant
#     - Large F value (44.31) means this predictor is effective in accounting for variation
#       in body depth of crabs.
#     - P-value < 0.05 (2.751e-10)  Therefore, this is in agreement that species does
#       have a significant effect on body depth for crabs.
# 5.  At what level is the interaction between gender and species significant?
#     Select the single best answer:
#       a. 99%
#       b. 97.5%
#       c. 95%
